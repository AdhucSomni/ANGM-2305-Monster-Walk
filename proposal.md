# Monster Walk

## Repository

## Description
Monster Walk is a 2D side-scroll built in Python, featuring an animated character sprite moving through a looping environment. This project is connected to media and digital arts through its focus on design, animation, and the creation of digital art created using code.

## Features
- Animated Sprite Movement
	- A pixel art sprite will be animated using a sequence of PNG frames to create movement. These frames will be cycled through based on frame timing in response to inputs from a user.
- Side-Scrolling Movement
	- The background will move horizontally opposite to the character’s direction using continous image/drawing repositioning to create a greater sense of movement through an environment.  
- Background Layers
	- Multiple background layers will scroll at different speeds by using varying movement speeds to produce depth in the environment.

## Challenges
- Learning how to design and implement animations using multiple PNG frames of a pixel sprite character in Pygame.
- Researching how to create a side-scrolling environment with looping backgrounds.
- How to manage frame timing and object movement within a game loop in pygames.

## Outcomes
Ideal Outcome:
- A polished side-scroller where an animated monster sprite can be moved without issue through a looping environment with minor visual transitions that convey atmosphere.  

Minimal Viable Outcome:
- A working program using pygame where a sprite can be controlled wih user inputs.

## Milestones

- Week 1
  1. Research sprite animation techniques to be used in Pygame and create the sprite to gather the png frames.
  2. Set up a basic window and display the sprite on screen.

- Week 2
  1. Implement character movement using keyboard input and the walking cycle. 
  2. Begin constructing the side-scrolling environment.

- Week 3 (Final)
  1. Refine visuals
  2. Debug and finalize repository with documentation and demo video.
